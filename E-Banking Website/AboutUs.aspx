        <br />
ABC Bank and Trust Company is widely recognized as one of the strongest and most progressive banks in the area. We're a locally owned community bank whose roots are right here in Normal. The ABC bank family, who came to Central Illinois in 1891, has been in banking for over 110 years. With the third generation of the family taking an active role in the banking business, we continue this tradition.
<br />
Fast, efficient service is important. Banking is personal. We build strong customer relationships by getting to know our customers and understanding their needs. The phrase "small enough to know you, big enough to serve you " is what ABC Bank is all about.
<br />
At ABC Bank, we're proud of the strength of our bank, the capabilities we have, the services we offer, and the people who offer those services to you. When you compare banks in terms of their strength, ABC Bank stands tall. Get to know us and you'll understand why.
